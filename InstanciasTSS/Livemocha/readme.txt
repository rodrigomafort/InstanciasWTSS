2 files are included:

1. nodes.csv
-- it's the file of all the users. This file works as a dictionary of all the users in this data set. It's useful for fast reference. It contains
all the node ids used in the dataset

2. edges.csv
-- this is the friendship network among the users. The friends are represented using edges. 
Here is an example. 

1,2

This means user with id "1" is friend with user id "2".
